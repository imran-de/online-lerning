                <p>Learn Without Limit was founded by Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng in 2012 with a vision of providing life-transforming learning experiences to learners around the world. Today, Learn Without Limit is a global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies. Learn Without Limit received B Corp certification in February 2021, which means that we have a legal duty not only to our shareholders, but to also make a positive impact on society more broadly, as we continue our efforts to reduce barriers to world-class education for all.</p>
                <p><b>82 million learners, 100+ Fortune 500 companies, and more than 6,000 campuses, businesses,</b> and <b>governments</b> come to Coursera to access world-class learningâ€”anytime, anywhere.</p>
